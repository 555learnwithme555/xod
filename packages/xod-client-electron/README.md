# xod-client-electron

This package is a part of the [XOD](https://github.com/xodio/xod) project.

The package is a thin wrapper around
[`xod-client`](https://github.com/xodio/xod/tree/master/packages/xod-client)
which lifts it to a ready-to-use desktop based XOD IDE.

It is based on [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/).
