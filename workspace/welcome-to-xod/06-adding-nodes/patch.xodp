In the node list (below the `welcome-to-xod`), you will find `xod/common-hardware` section. This is a *library* where you can find nodes to work with specific hardware.\n3. Find the `led` node. Note that nodes are arranged in alphabetical order.\n4. Hover the cursor over that node and click the burger button to access a context menu. There click “Place” to add the node onto a patch.\n5. Drag the new node to any slot. \n6. Now, assign the new values for the `PORT` and `LUM` pins to turn on the second LED.\n7. Upload the patch to the Arduino.\n\nBoth LEDs should turn on now.\n\nAlternatively, you may *drag* a node from the Project Browser instead of using the context menu. Try to add yet more `led` nodes to your project.",
